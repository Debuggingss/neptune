If you find some spaghetti code and would like to improve it, feel free to make a pull request!

To open the GUI, press Right-CTRL, can be changed in the Keybinds menu.

To set keybinds you have to use the default Minecraft keybind manager, might improve this myself one day.

This is more of a "proof of concept", not made to bypass cheat detection systems.
